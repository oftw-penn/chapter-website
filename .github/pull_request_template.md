### List of Changes:

- Adjustments to header regarding margin layout
- Development of landing page including the following elements: mission statement, events section, project section, fellowship section

### Notes:

- Carousel Functionality:  grommet carousels cannot display multiple items at once, so I still have to work out this bug. Also tried a few outside components from https://github.com/kareemaly/react-items-carousel and https://brainhubeu.github.io/react-carousel/docs/examples/multipleSlides, which also didn't seem to be working so the display is currently stagnant. Will definitely have to adjust this feature but was wondering if you had any input.
- Events/Projects: Currently there are dummy cards for these sections, but aiming to replace these with with a helper data function and just map the data.
- General syntax: could definitely improve style to make the code cleaner 
- Prepopulated links are currently maintained at the bottom of the page and will be deleted shortly. They are kept for convenience
